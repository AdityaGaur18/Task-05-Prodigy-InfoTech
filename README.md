# US Traffic Accident Analysis & Visualization

**Short Description:**
A data analysis project that explores US traffic accident data to identify trends, accident hotspots, and contributing factors using data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques in Python.

---

## Project Overview

This project analyzes a large-scale US traffic accident dataset (2016–2023) to understand when, where, and under what conditions traffic accidents occur. The notebook demonstrates a structured data analysis workflow, including data cleaning, feature exploration, and visual analytics.

The objective is to uncover meaningful patterns related to time, geography, weather, and road conditions that can support data-driven decision-making in traffic safety, urban planning, and infrastructure development.
